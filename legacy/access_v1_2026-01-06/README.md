# Legacy Access v1 Snapshot (2026-01-06)

This folder contains a reference snapshot of the Access-based Vinyl Record Management System (v1).
It is used for migration/design review only.

## Contents
- vba/       Exported VBA modules and form/report class modules (.bas/.cls)
- exports/   Reference exports of selected tables (.xlsx)
- docs/      Database documentation PDF

## Important
The `Vinyl.xlsx` in this snapshot is NOT guaranteed to match the current live Access database,
because new records were added after this export.
When we are ready for real data migration/import, generate a fresh export from the current Access DB.
